OPC-UA Adapters for the Grid Solutions Framework Time-series Library

#### License Notice

This library includes a binary distribution of the UA .NET Stack. The UA .NET Stack follows a dual-license:

* OPC Foundation Corporate Members: RCL
* Everybody else: GPL 2.0

_Since the OPCAdapters library uses GPL 2.0 library, it also must be licensed as GPL 2.0 - this is true even though all the GSF code is MIT licensed. As a result, this library cannot be automatically included with distributions that use the GSF Time-series Library, e.g., openPDC, SIEGate or openHistorian. GPL 2.0 allows for use of this library for private end-user deployment by simply copying the binaries into the target time-series library based application._
